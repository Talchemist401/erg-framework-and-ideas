      <!-- Foundational Understanding -->
      <h1 id="foundational-understanding" class="section-title">🔍 Foundational Understanding</h1>
      <h2 id="purpose-of-ergs">Purpose of ERGs</h2>
      <p>
        Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are employee-led networks within an organization that support people who share a common identity, interest, or experience. The primary purpose of ERGs is to provide groups of employees with a formal structure to support their unique needs related to specific personally identifying characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        As defined by the Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion, ERGs are "employee-led groups that serve many purposes depending on the organization and its focus, structure, sector and/or industry. Their primary purpose is to provide equity-seeking groups with a formal structure within the organization to support their unique needs."
      </p>
      <p>
        ERGs create a sense of community within the workplace, positively impacting employee morale and overall job satisfaction. They foster diversity, equity, and inclusion by giving employees a voice, and play a role in advancing business goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first official ERG in the United States, the Xerox National Black Employees Caucus, was created in 1970. Today, 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies have ERGs.
      </p>


      <h2 id="types-of-ergs">Types of ERGs</h2>
      <p>
        Employee resource groups can be formed based on any personally identifying characteristic or shared values and goals (e.g., environmental ERGs). Common types include:
      </p>
      <h3>Identity-Based ERGs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cultural/Ethnic (e.g., Black Employee Network, South Asian Network)</li>
        <li>LGBTQ+ (e.g., Pride)</li>
        <li>Women's Networks</li>
        <li>Veterans</li>
        <li>People with Disabilities (e.g., DiversAbility)</li>

        <li>Religious/Faith-based</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Retirees or those transitioning into retirement</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Special Interest ERGs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mental Health &amp; Wellness</li>

      </ul>
      <p>

      <h3>Impact on Company Culture and Employee Engagement</h3>
      <p>
        ERGs foster inclusion and a sense of belonging—helping employees be authentic at work. They also provide a countermeasure to remote work isolation and can increase engagement significantly.
      </p>
      <h3>Monetary Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        ERGs add business value by aligning with strategy, innovating, connecting with new customer bases, and improving recruitment, inclusion, engagement, and retention.

      <h3>Talent Acquisition and Development</h3>
      <p>
        ERGs contribute to recruiting and developing talent through leadership opportunities, cross-department collaboration, and personal growth initiatives.
      </p>
      <h3>Innovation and Business Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        By breaking down silos and sharing diverse insights, ERGs help drive innovation and reform business processes.

      <h3>Creating Your Mission Statement and Core Values</h3>
      <p>
        A clear mission statement defines your ERG’s purpose, guides activities, and communicates value. It should be specific, aligned with organizational values, concise, and highlight both member and business benefits.

      <h3>Establishing a Vision and Purpose Statement</h3>
      <p>
        A vision statement describes what success looks like. For example: "To create a workplace where women feel empowered and supported, leading to increased representation in leadership."
      </p>

      <p>
        Securing support from management, HR, and stakeholders provides legitimacy and resources. Sample messages outline the purpose, benefits, proposed structure, and resource needs.
