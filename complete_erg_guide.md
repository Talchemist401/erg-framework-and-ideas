# Foundational Understanding

## Purpose of ERGs

Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are employee-led networks within an organization that support people who share a common identity, interest, or experience. The primary purpose of ERGs is to provide groups of employees with a formal structure within the organization to support their unique needs related to specific personally identifying characteristics, including visible and invisible identities or qualities.

As defined by the Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion, ERGs are "employee-led groups that serve many purposes depending on the organization and its focus, structure, sector and/or industry. Their primary purpose is to provide equity-seeking groups with a formal structure within the organization to support their unique needs."

ERGs create a sense of community within the workplace, which can positively impact employee morale and overall job satisfaction. They foster diversity, equity, and inclusion by giving employees a voice, and play a role in advancing the goals of the business.

The first official ERG in the United States, the Xerox National Black Employees Caucus, was created in 1970 as a forum for Black employees to advocate for inclusion and change within the company. Since that time, ERGs across North America have connected groups of employees who share interests and identities. Today, 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies have ERGs.

## Types of ERGs

Employee resource groups can be formed based on any personally identifying characteristic or, more recently, shared values and goals (e.g., environmental ERGs). While not an exhaustive list, common types of ERGs include:

### Identity-Based ERGs
- Cultural/Ethnic (e.g., Black Employee Network, South Asian Network)
- LGBTQ+ (e.g., Pride)
- Women's Networks
- Veterans
- People with Disabilities (e.g., DiversAbility)
- Indigenous/First Nations
- Religious/Faith-based

### Life Stage and Circumstance ERGs
- New Hires
- Young Professionals
- Family and Parents (e.g., single parents, working parents, family caregivers)
- Retirees or those transitioning into retirement

### Special Interest ERGs
- Mental Health & Wellness
- Environmental & Climate Action
- Neurodiversity (e.g., employees with Autism or ADHD)
- Language-based
- International (e.g., newcomers or immigrants)
- Inter-generational

There are various names for ERGs depending on the organization. Terms include affinity groups, employee network groups, special interest groups, and business resource groups (BRGs). The term "business resource group" is generally used for mature groups that have an established strategic role and impact in the organization.

## Case Studies of Successful ERGs

- **MAP (Mental Awareness Project)** - Works to eliminate the stigma of mental health challenges and to bring awareness to tools, resources and support for employees that may need them.

## Benefits Analysis

### Impact on Company Culture and Employee Engagement

ERGs foster inclusion in a number of ways, including by helping employees feel that they belong and are part of a community, especially through connections that counter the feelings of being an "only" within an organization. Belonging to an ERG also helps employees feel that they can be authentic at work, and derive more meaning and purpose from the work that they do.

Now more than ever, people crave a sense of community. But it's hard to make time for friendships outside of work. What's more, the rise of remote work is fueling an epidemic of loneliness. One study found that since they started working remotely, 67% of workers find it "harder to make friends and maintain relationships with work colleagues." The creation of and participation in these groups can help your team bond with like-minded people. And having friends at work makes people approximately twice as likely to be engaged.

### Monetary Benefits

ERGs provide significant business value through:

1. **Business strategy alignment and innovation**: ERGs can be a vital source of input when developing inclusive policies and practices, as the diversity of viewpoints can lead to more successful implementation. They can better locate areas needing improvement or attention, leading to the development of more innovative solutions to business challenges. By embracing these viewpoints, companies with ERGs are likely to do better in DEI implementation.

2. **Connect with an extended or new customer base**: ERGs can help an organization connect with specific customer demographics, understand the needs of a diverse market of customers, and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Specialized network groups can be excellent forums for idea generation and sounding boards for targeted campaigns. They can act as in-house focus groups and a formalized source of information for the organization.

3. **Recruitment, inclusion, engagement, and retention**: ERGs can improve diversity across the organization by suggesting process improvements in recruitment, development, or retention of a diverse workforce. They may be able to provide direction on the best techniques for recruiting members of the group that the ERG represents and can be explicitly leveraged for referrals in recruitment.

### Retention Benefits

Employees who are members of an ERG are likely to identify more with their organization and be more satisfied at work. When employees feel like they belong and are connected to a community, they are likely to stay with the organization longer. Additionally, the feelings of inclusion and belonging that ERGs foster can help reduce turnover.

One survey found that "70% of Gen Z respondents were more likely to apply for a job at a company with an ERG." And across all age groups, more than 50% said they'd be more likely to stay with a company that had Employee Resource Groups.

### Talent Acquisition and Development

ERGs help with recruiting efforts by participating in talent attraction. The participation of ERG members, for example, in diverse panels and recruiting events, shows potential employees that a welcoming community exists at the organization they are considering joining. 

To support the career advancement of their members, ERGs foster sponsorship within or outside the ERG. And to improve the retention of underrepresented groups, some ERGs work with HR and leadership to communicate the needs of these groups.

In addition to fostering relationships and a culture of inclusion, ERGs support employees' career growth. That can happen in several different ways:

1. Members get leadership experience by running the ERG itself, holding events, and creating company-wide campaigns
2. As ERG networks grow, leaders and members learn from each other, collaborate, and discuss how best to move the work forward
3. By working as a team, colleagues from different departments offer each other new perspectives and insights to boost their career and personal growth

### Innovation and Business Outcomes

In a large organization, there's an ever-present risk of silos. Everyone has their own areas of expertise and teams become so specialized that they can develop inertia. Because Employee Resource Groups include people from across departments and roles, they can kickstart creativity by sharing processes and insights cross-functionally. Whether or not the ERG itself suggests new projects, members will bring fresh insights into their everyday roles.

By connecting their members to colleagues and parts of the business looking to embed diversity in operations and core strategy, ERGs drive social impact. Within local communities, ERGs help improve brand visibility through volunteer activities and charitable giving to causes that ERGs consider important. Through ERG inputs, companies better understand their customers and are able to cater products to underrepresented groups. ERGs also help reform business operations, for example, when members of underrepresented groups call attention to unfair processes.

# Establishment Guide

## Formation Phase

### Creating Your Mission Statement and Core Values

A clear mission statement is essential for any successful ERG. It defines your purpose, guides your activities, and helps communicate your value to the organization. When crafting your mission statement:

1. **Be specific about your purpose**: Clearly articulate why your ERG exists and who it serves.
2. **Align with organizational values**: Ensure your mission complements the company's overall mission and values.
3. **Keep it concise**: Aim for a statement that is clear, memorable, and easy to communicate.
4. **Include both member and business benefits**: Address how the ERG will support both its members and the organization.

#### Example Mission Statement:
"The Women's Inspiration Network (WIN) empowers women at [Company Name] to connect, inspire, and impact others through personal and professional development opportunities while contributing to the company's goals of creating an inclusive workplace and driving innovation through diverse perspectives."

### Core Values

Establishing core values helps define your ERG's culture and guides decision-making. Consider including values such as:

- **Inclusion**: Creating a welcoming environment for all employees
- **Growth**: Supporting personal and professional development
- **Advocacy**: Championing equity and representation
- **Collaboration**: Working together across departments and with other ERGs
- **Impact**: Making meaningful contributions to the organization and community

### Establishing a Vision and Purpose Statement

While your mission statement defines what you do and why, a vision statement describes what success looks like for your ERG in the future.

#### Example Vision Statement:
"To create a workplace where women at all levels feel empowered, supported, and have equal opportunities to advance their careers, resulting in increased representation of women in leadership positions and a more inclusive company culture."

### Requesting Internal Support

Before formally establishing your ERG, it's crucial to secure support from management, HR, and other key stakeholders. This support provides legitimacy, resources, and organizational alignment.

#### Example Message to Management/TA/HR Team:

*If your ERG's formation has been approved...*

### Securing Executive Sponsorship

Executive sponsors provide critical support, visibility, and advocacy for ERGs. They help connect the ERG to senior leadership, provide guidance on aligning with business objectives, and can help secure resources.

When seeking an executive sponsor:

1. **Identify potential sponsors**: Look for leaders who have demonstrated commitment to diversity and inclusion, have influence within the organization, and ideally have some connection to the ERG's focus area.

2. **Prepare a clear pitch**: Explain the ERG's purpose, goals, and how it aligns with business objectives. Be specific about what you're asking of them as a sponsor.

3. **Clarify expectations**: Define the sponsor's role, including time commitment, responsibilities, and how they'll interact with the ERG leadership team.

#### Executive Sponsor Responsibilities:
- Advocate for the ERG at leadership levels
- Help secure resources and budget
- Provide strategic guidance and mentorship
- Attend key ERG events and meetings
- Help remove organizational barriers
- Connect the ERG to relevant business initiatives

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

### Alignment with Non-discrimination Policies

ERGs must operate in accordance with the organization's non-discrimination policies and relevant laws. Key considerations include:

1. **Inclusive membership**: While ERGs may focus on specific identity groups, membership should be open to all employees, including allies.

2. **Non-discriminatory practices**: ERG activities, events, and communications should not discriminate against any protected groups.

3. **Compliance with workplace policies**: ERGs must adhere to all company policies regarding conduct, communication, and use of company resources.

### Liability Considerations

To mitigate potential liability issues:

1. **Document ERG structure and governance**: Create clear bylaws or terms of reference that outline the ERG's purpose, structure, and operating procedures.

2. **Maintain records**: Keep documentation of meetings, events, and decisions.

3. **Review communications**: Ensure all ERG communications are professional and align with company standards.

4. **Consult with legal/HR**: When in doubt about potential liability issues, consult with the organization's legal or HR department.

### Inclusivity Requirements

While ERGs often focus on specific identity groups, they should be designed to be inclusive:

1. **Open membership**: Membership should be open to all employees, including those who don't share the identity but want to support as allies.

2. **Accessible events and communications**: Ensure ERG activities are accessible to all members, including those with disabilities.

3. **Intersectionality awareness**: Recognize that individuals may belong to multiple identity groups and avoid creating silos between different ERGs.

### Integration with Company Policies

ERGs should operate within the framework of existing company policies:

1. **Review relevant policies**: Familiarize yourself with policies related to diversity and inclusion, employee groups, use of company resources, and communications.

2. **Establish clear connection points**: Identify how the ERG will interact with HR, diversity and inclusion teams, and other relevant departments.

3. **Policy modification requests**: If existing policies create barriers for the ERG, develop a formal process for requesting modifications, supported by clear rationale and business benefits.

# Recruitment and Engagement

## Internal Recruitment for Core Roles

Recruiting the right people for your ERG leadership team is crucial for success. Here are strategies to identify and attract talented individuals to core roles:

### Identifying Potential Leaders

1. **Look for demonstrated interest**: Identify employees who have shown interest in diversity and inclusion initiatives or have participated actively in ERG events.

2. **Seek diverse skills**: Look beyond subject matter expertise to find individuals with complementary skills in project management, communication, event planning, and budget management.

3. **Consider different levels and departments**: Include employees from various levels and departments to ensure diverse perspectives and broader organizational reach.

4. **Identify hidden talent**: Some employees may have relevant experience or passion that isn't visible in their current role. Use surveys or informal conversations to uncover these hidden talents.

### Recruitment Strategies

1. **Personal outreach**: Direct invitations from current ERG leaders or executive sponsors can be very effective.

2. **Information sessions**: Host informal meetings to share information about leadership opportunities and answer questions.

3. **Shadow programs**: Allow interested employees to shadow current leaders before committing to a role.

4. **Highlight development benefits**: Emphasize how ERG leadership roles develop transferable skills that benefit career advancement.

5. **Create entry-level opportunities**: Establish committee roles or project-based positions that require less time commitment as entry points to leadership.

# Growth and Sustainability

## Intersectionality Approaches

Intersectionality recognizes that individuals often belong to multiple identity groups simultaneously, and their experiences are shaped by these overlapping identities. Effective ERGs acknowledge and address intersectionality in their structure and programming.

### Understanding Intersectionality in ERGs

Intersectionality in ERGs means recognizing that:
- Members may identify with multiple ERGs (e.g., a woman of color might connect with both women's and cultural ERGs)
